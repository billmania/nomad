How to identify and encode the waypoints

The first (starting) waypoint is located on the positive X axis,
ie. Y = 0.  The rover begins at the origin, pointed in the
direction of the positive X axis.

Measurement loop after establishing the starting waypoint
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Use a metric tape measure and a hand-bearing compass to determine
the range and bearing from the current waypoint to the next
waypoint. If possible, measure the range and bearing from the
previous waypoint to the next waypoint.

Use the Law of Cosines to determine/verify the distance between
the previous waypoint and the next waypoint. Then use the same Law of
Cosines to determine/verify the three angles between the sides.

Next, use the Law of Sines to calculate the X and Y offset from
the current waypoint to the next waypoint. Use those offsets to
determine the coordinates of the next waypoint.


Formulae
-----------------------------------------------------------------

c is the distance from the previous waypoint to the current
waypoint.

a is the distance from the current waypoint to the next waypoint.

b is the distance from the previous waypoint to the next waypoint.

B is the angle between c and a.

C is the angle between a and b.


b = sqrt(a^^2 + c^^2 - 2ac * cos(B))

C = arccos((a^^2 + b^^2 - c^^2) / (2ab))

Then to calculate the X and Y offset from the current waypoint:

if B is greater than 90 degrees (next waypoint in Q1 or Q4)

    a' = a

    A' = 90

    B' = 180 - B

    C' = 180 - B' - A'

    X offset = a' * cos(B')

    Y offset = if Q1:  [a' * sin(B')]
               if Q4: -[a' * sin(B')]

if B is less than 90 degrees (next waypoint in Q2 or Q3)

    a' = a

    A' = 90

    B' = B

    C' = 180 - B' - A'

    X offset = -[a' * cos(B')]

    Y offset = if Q2:  [a' * sin(B')]
               if Q4: -[a' * sin(B')]

if B equals 90 degrees
    
    X offset = 0

    Y offset = if Q1 or Q2:  a
               if Q3 or Q4: -a
