        allows us to switch between using navigator_capture_waypoint and the navigator_capture_cone nodes to move the robot base.
        the strategy node will handle switching the mux from one input to another, depending on how close
        we are to the next cone waypoint.
        
        can manually switch with the following commands:
            rosservice call mux_cmd_vel/select cmd_vel_capture_waypoint
            rosservice call mux_cmd_vel/select cmd_vel_capture_cone
