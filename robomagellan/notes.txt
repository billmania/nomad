wheel encoders / imu
   remove the offset for the left wheel rotating faster
   need to maximize x-dir velocity (can we max out the top velocity, but decrease the acceleration, so we don't peel out?)
   need better IMU/yaw data

navigation:
  add obstacle avoidance
  switch to cone capture mode always, if we are sufficiently close

cone_capture:
  need to increase speed of cone capture in x-dir
  be more agressive about correcting for left/right when capturing the cone
  better tweaking of parameters on cone_tracker node? why couldn't it see the cone?
  start storing the camera data in a ros bag
  get good numbers for the HSV
   inside, outside, cloudy, sunny, in the shade, partially obscured

need a quick way of creating a waypoints file on competition day

robot should avoid going out of the field -- add restriction to our navigation system
