navigation updates
  to rotate to get back on path, turn in small increments, stopping in between
  cone capture: move forward in small increments, so that it can get close enough to touch, but doesn't
    run over the cone
  add obstacle avoidance at 60cm

Testing:

  test new cone capture code 
    should touch cone but not run over it

  test drift offset correction with robomagellan_localization

  test obstacle avoidance

Test run scenarios:

  backyard/hallway

  tennis courts

  park, with path along sidewalk (but chance to go in the grass)


TODOs:

  need a quick way of creating a waypoints file on competition day

  robot should avoid going out of the field -- add restriction to our navigation system
