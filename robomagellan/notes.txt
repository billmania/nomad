cone_capture:
  test camera cone capture node on the robot
  get good numbers for the HSV
   inside, outside, cloudy, sunny, in the shade, partially obscured

experiment with covariances on wheel_odom and imu_data,
  how does robot_pose_ekf use this data?

is it the goal angular tolerance that is causing weird trajectories?

move_base:
    it seems like the local and global plan can get off from each other?

add some more interesting waypoints to loyola-park sim (near the trees)

need a quick way of creating a waypoints file on competition day

robot should avoid going out of the field
