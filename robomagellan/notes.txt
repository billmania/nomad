wheel encoders / imu
   need better IMU/yaw data

navigation:
  add obstacle avoidance
  switch to cone capture mode always, if we are sufficiently close

cone_capture:
  better tweaking of parameters on cone_tracker node? why couldn't it see the cone?
  start storing the camera data in a ros bag
  get good numbers for the HSV
   inside, outside, cloudy, sunny, in the shade, partially obscured

need a quick way of creating a waypoints file on competition day

robot should avoid going out of the field -- add restriction to our navigation system
