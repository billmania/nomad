update robomagellan_localization to take in /robot_pose_ekf_odom and publish Odometry
on /odom topic (using this as example: http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/Odom)
related: update simulation stack to have stage input -> robot_pose_ekf, so that we can 
  use robot_pose_ekf even in simulation

TODOs in cone_capture.py

tweak params in move_base so it isn't always freaking out about non-existent obstacles
    it seems like the local and global plan can get off from each other?

add some more interesting waypoints to loyola-park sim (near the trees)

need a quick way of creating a waypoints file on competition day
