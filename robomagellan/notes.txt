test camera cone capture node on the robot
  need to install opencv

TODOs in cone_capture.py

tweak params in move_base so it isn't always freaking out about non-existent obstacles
    it seems like the local and global plan can get off from each other?

add some more interesting waypoints to loyola-park sim (near the trees)

need a quick way of creating a waypoints file on competition day
